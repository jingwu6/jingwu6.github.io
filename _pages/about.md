⭐ **Announcement:** I'm excited to announce that I will be on the job market in **2024**! If you have opportunities or collaborations in mind, please feel free to reach out. ⭐


## 🎓 **Background**

I am currently pursuing my **Ph.D.** at the [**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**](https://illinois.edu/). I'm honored to be under the guidance of [**Prof. Naira Hovakimyan**](https://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/). 

During my academic journey, I collaborated with [**Intelinair**](https://www.intelinair.com/) as a research scientist in machine learning, mentored by [**Jennifer Hobbs**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zeWhseAAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I've honed my skills as an interned applied research scientist at [**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/buyer-risk-prevention).

## 🔍 **Research Interests**

My research is primarily in the fields of **machine learning**, **computer vision** and **multi-modality learning**. In particular, I'm interested in exploring **improved representation learning** techniques to aid machines in comprehending the structure of massive amounts of unlabeled data.

In industry applications, my efforts are devoted to **remote sensing**, **robotics** and **sustainable agriculture**. My philosophy towards research is centered around bringing people's lives and AI technology together at scale. 

Deeply motivated by the challenges associated with creating innovative technologies.
