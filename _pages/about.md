I am currently an Applied Research Scientist at AWS, Amazon, working on Generative AI.

I got my **Ph.D.** from [**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**](https://illinois.edu/), guided by [**Prof. Naira Hovakimyan**](https://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/). I've also been a research scientist in machine learning at [**Intelinair**](https://www.intelinair.com/), mentored by [**Jennifer Hobbs**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zeWhseAAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I interned as an applied research scientist at [**Amazon**](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/buyer-risk-prevention).

## üîç **Research Interests**

My research is primarily in the fields of **LLM**, **computer vision** and **multi-modality learning**. In particular, I'm interested in exploring **improved representation learning** techniques to aid machines in comprehending the structure of massive amounts of unlabeled data.

In industry applications, my efforts are devoted to **remote sensing**, **robotics** and **sustainable agriculture**. My philosophy towards research is centered around bringing people's lives and AI technology together at scale.
