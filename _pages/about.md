I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Naira Hovakimyan](https://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/). I was funded by [Intelinair](https://www.intelinair.com/) as a research scientist in machine learning under the supervision of [Jennifer Hobbs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zeWhseAAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research Interests
======
My research is primarily in the field of **machine learning** and **computer vision**. In particular, I'm interested in exploring **improved representation learning** techniques to aid machines in comprehending the structure of massive amounts of unlabeled data.

In industry applications, my efforts are devoted to **remote sensing**, **robotics** and **sustainable agriculture**. My philosophy towards research is centered around bringing people's life and AI technology together at scale. 

Deeply motivated by the challenges associated with creating innovative technologies.

<!-- A data-driven personal website -->
<!-- ======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
