**Abstract** \
Classifying and segmenting patterns from a few examples is a key problem in remote sensing and earth observation, as acquiring large amounts of accurately labeled, and ground-truthed data is difficult. Prior works show that meta-learning, based on episodic training on query and support sets, is a promising approach. Yet, direct fine-tuning techniques have drawn scant attention. The objective of this paper is to repurpose contrastive learning as a pretraining method for few-shot learning for both classification and semantic segmentation tasks for remote sensing. We find that fine-tuning of embeddings learned from contrastive methods is crucial to the few-shot learning tasks. With only a few labeled samples, such a simple approach outperforms supervised learning methods. We evaluate our approach on two key remote sensing datasets: Agriculture-Vision and EuroSAT. Combining these contrastive methods with only a few labeled examples, our approach outperforms purely supervised training on the nearly 95,000 images in Agriculture-Vision on both classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Similarly, the proposed few-shot method achieved better results on the land-cover classification task on EuroSAT compared with supervised model training on the fully supervised dataset.
